Auto-IR Runbook

Human + Amazon Bedrock Incident Response

Purpose
This runbook defines how a human on-call engineer uses the Bedrock-generated incident report safely, verifies it against raw evidence, and produces a final, auditable incident artifact.

Core rule:
Bedrock accelerates analysis. Humans own correctness.
